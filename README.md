# UW assessment tool (GitHub Pages)

## How to publish with GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (Public is simplest for Pages).
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repository root (same level as `index.html`).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Select **Branch: main** (or master) and **Folder: / (root)**, then **Save**.
6. Open the Pages URL shown on that screen.

## Notes
- This project is a single-file web app. `index.html` contains all the code.
- `.nojekyll` prevents GitHub Pages from applying Jekyll processing.
